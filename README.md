# Minesweeper
My take on minesweeper in C++, stil a work IN PROGRESS and the code needs some cleaning

Basic game should work just fine, AI not yet.
Game has no GUI so all info about how many mines are left is printed to console.

Completely my work, except for the graphics
I'm using the SFML library.
