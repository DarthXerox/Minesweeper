# Minesweeper
My take on minesweeper in C++, this is just the base game, AI is not finished yet
Completely my work, except for the graphics, I'm using the SFML library.

To play, first install smfl graphics library:
https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php
then compile using "make" command then launch "./Minesweeper" and enjoy :)

Controls:
Left click to uncover a tile and right click to flag it or mark it as a question mark.
The game has no GUI so all info about how many mines are left is printed to console.
